normalization: max/min, values between [0,1]
	v' = (v - min) / (max - min) * (new_max - new_min) + new_min
standardization: rescale to have SD of 1 and mean of 0
	v'= (v - µ) / σ


Journal:

1. Try buying when price is above moving average and selling when price is below moving average
2. BTC price is available at increments of 1 min, can toggle "time_delta" in code to make 50 "day" moving average, for instance, to correspond to 50 minutes, 50 hours, 50 days, etc...
3. Add parameters to allow for different proportions of cash willing to spend and/or coin willing to sell
4. Played around adjusting time_delta and rank of moving average (rank would be the "50" in "50 day moving avg")
5. day that mostly saw increase in btc price: rank 50, units of hours, did really well, ~90% increase
6. day that saw bimodal increases in btc price: same parameters as above did good, ~24% increase; rank 200 units of hours, ~57% increase; rank 50 units of days saw similar increase, ~57% increase
7. day that saw initial decrease in btc price: model saw poor performance, rank 50 units hours, -23%; rank 200 units of hours, -6%
8. day that saw overall decrease: model saw neutral performance, rank 50 unit hours, 2.4%; rank 200 unit hours, 14.69%
9. ON POOR PERFORMANCE DAYS: distance between btc price curve and overall wealth curve are well matched is small in beginning but gap increases as day goes on, however, shape of curve is generally matched  
10. OBSERVATION: days that do well, very minimal distance between two curves, this distance can be attempted to be minimized in a cost function for an ML model!
